# Replicating This Interactive Map Editor

This guide explains how to create a similar interactive map editor using your own background image and data.

## Project Overview

This is a browser-based SVG overlay editor that allows you to:
- Draw and edit **districts** (polygonal areas)
- Draw and edit **roads** (polylines with different types)
- Place and manage **POI markers** (points of interest)
- Draw **walls** (circles)
- Add **terrain overlays** (forest, mountains, grass)
- Export all data as JSON or download as defaults
- Import/export SVG overlays
