# Path of Exile Passive Skill Tree (Compact)

This tree is a compact representation derived from `poeskilltree.json`. It lists every
passive skill node, its requirements, metadata, and connections while keeping the
overall footprint under 1000 kB.

- `ascendancies/`: Nodes that belong to each ascendancy.
- `general/`: Non-ascendancy nodes arranged by gameplay-relevant categories.
- `groups.md`: Positional groups with layout metadata from the original tree.
