# Changelog

## Guidelines for future updates
- List changes in reverse chronological order (newest first).
- Use a heading for each version or date, followed by brief bullet points.
- Summaries should be short, highlighting major additions or fixes. Each bullet must contain at least five hundred characters to provide sufficient detail.
