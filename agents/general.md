General Contribution Guidelines
===============================

- Follow the coding style already present in the repository. Use two spaces for
  indentation in JavaScript and aim to keep lines under 80 characters.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single topic so reviewers can easily follow
  the intent. Avoid mixing unrelated fixes with new features.
- Provide clear commit messages summarizing the change. The first line should be
  a concise summary in the imperative mood, followed by a blank line and any
  additional details.
- Include code comments for complex logic and remove any unused code instead of
  commenting it out.
- When updating documentation or assets, mention the reason for the change in
  the commit message.
