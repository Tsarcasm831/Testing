Changelog Maintenance
=====================

- Record each change in `CHANGELOG.md` using UTC-7 dates.
- Prefix every bullet with the time in `HHMM` format.
- `CHANGELOG.md` must only show entries from the current UTC day.
- Move earlier entries to `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`, keeping them in reverse chronological order.
- Keep bullet points detailed but concise.
