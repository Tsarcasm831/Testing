Changelog Updates
=================

- Record each change in `CHANGELOG.md` with a short bullet summary.
- Group bullets under a heading using `date -u +%Y-%m-%d` for the date.
- Prefix every bullet with the time from `date -u +%H%M`.
- Keep only the latest ten bullet entries from days before today in `CHANGELOG.md` and move older ones to `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`. Bullets from the current UTC day may exceed this limit.
