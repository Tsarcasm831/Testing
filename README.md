## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/15efec1d-ab64-4b92-8aa6-ac5f11bbfe63) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?

- Tailwind CSS

## How can I deploy this project?

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/15efec1d-ab64-4b92-8aa6-ac5f11bbfe63) and click on Share -> Publish.

### Manual deployment

If you are hosting the site yourself, you need to upload the **dist** directory
generated by the build step. Running:

```sh
npm run build
```

creates a `dist/` folder containing the optimized HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The
`index.html` inside that folder references the compiled assets (e.g.
`/assets/index-<hash>.js`). Deploy the contents of `dist/` to your web server
instead of the project source files. Uploading the raw `src/` directory will
cause browsers to try to load `.tsx` files directly, resulting in MIME type
errors like "disallowed MIME type (application/octet-stream)".

## Can I connect a custom domain to my Lovable project?

Yes, you can!
