# Ark Survival Ascended Python Clone (MVP)

This project provides a very small, minimal clone of **Ark: Survival Ascended** using the `pygame` library. It is a simplified 2D survival game demonstrating basic mechanics such as resource gathering, crafting, building structures, and taming dinosaurs.

## Features
* Topâ€‘down 2D view
* Player movement
* Random resources (wood, stone) to gather
* Basic crafting of simple structures
* Simple dinosaurs that can be tamed
* Inventory tracking

The goal is to showcase a minimal structure for a survival game using Python.

## Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* `pygame` 2.0+

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game
```bash
python -m src.game
```

Use arrow keys to move, `E` to interact, `B` to build.
