          As a child and a young adult I enjoyed role-playing very much. My friends and I would get
          together on a Saturday afternoon and play for hours. We would play Dungeons&Dragons
          primarily with a smattering of other games sprinkled in from time-to-time to break up the
          monotony. It was always fun, but in my mind at least all the games available seemed to focus
          more on stringent rules and mathematical formulas than on the story being presented, and the
          fun we were supposed to be having. I've always felt role-playing should be an escape from
          your problems for a few hours, and not a math problem.
        </p>

          In the winter of 1992 I was a soldier in the United States Army. I had met many other
          soldiers who had interest in role-playing games and shared my thoughts on the over use of
          rules for rules sake and the arguments that always ensued over each person's interpretation
          of the rules. I also took exception to people who would run stories where their character was
          a deity while yours was forever mediocre. I believe the player characters should always be
          the stars of the show and all NPCs should be there to add dimension to the world and flavor
          to the setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing I have never agreed with is the “Killer DM, or Killer Storyteller” These folks
          who do everything they can to harangue and kill the player characters as quickly and as often
          as possible. I found it hard to be invested in a story where my character would most likely
          be dead within three game sessions and I'd have to roll a new one. That was frustrating and
          made me lose interest. In my mind it's a poor storyteller who kills off all of his characters
          in the first chapter or for the sake of shock value, Mr. George R.R. Martin.

          [1:41 PM]ArmyOfGunn: So I decided to take matters into my own hands and if I couldn't find a
          system I could get behind, I'd simply have to make one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the beginning the system was very free-form and had very few rules. This was alright, but
          soon proved to be as frustrating as having too many rules. Rolling dice for the sake of
          rolling dice gets old and changing the rules and game mechanics every game session got old
          fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I sat down one day and hashed out rules that make sense to me, and made the game work
          properly without bogging down the story. Every rule in this book is there to make the game
          flow and trust me it does.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've spent twenty two years making sure of it Even with that in mind, anyone playing this
          game, using this system or running a story is free to use any rules they choose and bend and
          break the ones that hinder your playing style. Role-playing is supposed to be fun, and if it
          isn't, why play? In the following pages you'll find everything you need to begin adventuring
          in the Savage Wastes. I hope you enjoy the game and the system and will use it for many years
          to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is as what I like to call roleplaying for grown-ups. It can be as dirty, gritty and violent
          as you like, or tone it down and make it more family friendly, the choice is yours. At any
          rate, have fun, and enjoy the fruits of my labor.
