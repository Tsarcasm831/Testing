1156 Realigned every remote asset reference to match the canonical storage list so that resources load from a single reliable domain. Previously the project pulled dozens of animated models and audio tracks from transient file.garden URLs that regularly expired or were throttled, causing broken links and runtime errors wherever an avatar or soundtrack was expected to stream. By scanning list.json for the authoritative paths and rewriting each entry in assets.json to point at https://www.lordtsarcasm.com/public_html/bucket/, the asset pipeline now leverages persistent hosting with consistent directory structure. This consolidation simplifies maintenance scripts, improves caching behavior for clients, and provides a stable foundation for future contributions that depend on dependable remote resources without fearing sudden provider shutdowns or content relocation.
1142 Introduced a dedicated video settings interface to centralize control of all screen-related features. Pressing the "v" key now opens a modal that pauses player input and presents administrative tools for updating the amphitheater's video source, removing the previously scattered controls from the general options panel. The component ships with its own stylesheet for consistent styling and is initialized through the UI manager alongside other HUD elements. By isolating video configuration in one place and gating the URL field to the existing admin account, maintainers no longer need to hunt through unrelated menus to manage playback, paving the way for future additions like volume or subtitle toggles without bloating the main options menu. This restructuring improves discoverability for routine show setups while reducing clutter for regular players.
