# Changelog

## 2025-07-30

- 1318 Documented a major revision to the repository's contribution guidelines. The AGENTS.md file now clarifies that each new entry in CHANGELOG.md must contain a description that is at least five hundred characters long. This update is mirrored in agents/changelog.md and ensures future changes are fully explained, including context, rationale and any required follow-up actions, so developers can reproduce results with minimal confusion. We also moved previous updates from July twenty-ninth into the archive so that the daily changelog only reflects the most recent work.

## Guidelines for future updates
- List changes in reverse chronological order (newest first).
- Use a heading for each version or date, followed by brief bullet points.
- Summaries should be short, highlighting major additions or fixes.
