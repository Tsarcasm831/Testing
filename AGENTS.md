# Repository Guidelines

This repository contains a browser-based game. Follow these rules when contributing:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use modern ES6 module syntax in JavaScript files under `src/`.
- Keep binary assets such as models and audio in the `assets` directory.
- When adding assets, optimize their size to keep the repository lightweight.
- To preview locally, you can run `python3 -m http.server` from the repository root and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
