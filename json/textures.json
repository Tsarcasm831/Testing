        "name": "Cracked Concrete (Weathered)",
        "albedo": "Light and mid-gray concrete slab with scattered moss stains, darkened crevices, and high-contrast water damage. Faint dirt discoloration creates urban decay tones.",
        "normal": "Deep, fractured cracks of varying widths with chipped edges, pitted cavities, and broken cement texture creating height and depth.",
        "roughness": "Dry, matte surface with very low reflectivity. Uneven roughness from erosion, with higher friction in mossy and broken regions.",
        "ao": "Soft self-shadowing in crevices, cracks, and pits. Deeper fissures create strong ambient occlusion with light shading in surface recesses."
      },
      {
        "name": "Eroded Asphalt / Road Debris",
        "albedo": "Dark grey-black asphalt with faded white and yellow lines, scattered gravel, oil streaks, and dust patches creating a distressed roadway appearance.",
        "normal": "Craggy surface with embedded gravel, layered cracks, and tread impressions. Subtle tire-wear lines add dimensionality.",
        "roughness": "Low reflectivity with high roughness in gravel areas. Slightly smoother near oil streaks but mostly dull and gritty.",
        "ao": "Strong occlusion in recesses, gravel pits, and between cracks. Road paint provides low AO while pitted areas have high shadowing."
      },
      {
        "name": "Rusted Metal Plating (Corrugated)",
        "albedo": "Orange-brown rust with darker streaks and traces of aged blue-grey steel beneath. Flaking paint and corrosion splotches cover the metal surface.",
        "normal": "Repeating corrugated ridges with jagged rust flakes, bolt dents, and edge warping. Texture is uneven and deeply eroded.",
        "roughness": "Medium to high roughness with inconsistent reflectivity. Corroded rust patches are rougher than exposed metal stripes.",
        "ao": "Shadowed areas inside grooves and under rust layers. High occlusion along creases and behind bolt indentations."
      },
      {
        "name": "Reinforced Steel Grid (Scorched)",
        "albedo": "Blackened steel with charred burn marks, oxidized dark blues and purples, and heat-distorted metal tones from fire exposure.",
        "normal": "Reinforced X-grid bars with blistered metal, dented rivets, and scorched surface deformation. Warping suggests heat damage.",
        "roughness": "Mostly rough with scorched matte finish. Heat-blistered zones are glossier, showing slightly warped metallic shine.",
        "ao": "Ambient shadows around grid intersections, bolt bases, and burnt-in cracks. Soot-darkened creases have heavy occlusion."
      },
      {
        "name": "Organic Mutated Flesh / Veined Biomass",
        "albedo": "Wet pink-red flesh with purplish bruising and glowing green veins coursing across semi-translucent tissue. Viscera streaks and discoloration throughout.",
        "normal": "Bulging veins, layered muscle fibers, and warped skin tissue create high biological variation in surface elevation.",
        "roughness": "Mostly glossy with slick, shiny regions near vein bulges and moist surface areas. Flesh creases slightly less reflective.",
        "ao": "Deep shadowing along veins and under folds of flesh. Occlusion strong in muscular crevices and indentations between tissue layers."
