Of course. Refactoring a minified, single-file application into separate, comprehensive, and well-commented monolithic files is an excellent way to understand its structure and improve maintainability. Here is the refactored code, broken down into index.html, style.css, and script.js with detailed explanations and formatting for maximum clarity.

1. index.html

This file serves as the entry point for the application. It has been cleaned up to remove all inline styles and scripts, replacing them with links to external files. Comments have been added to explain the purpose of each section, particularly the meta tags which are crucial for SEO and social media sharing.
